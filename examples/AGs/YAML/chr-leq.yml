  title: CHR Partial Order Example
  notes: >
    This example illustrates how argumentation schemes are mapped to 
    Constraint Handling Rules (CHR). While any CHR program
    can be represented with argumentation schemes in Carneades,
    assumptions ("facts") must be ground, i.e. not contain
    any variables. This limits the CHR queries which may
    be expressed, but assures that all statements
    in Carneades argument graphs are ground formulas. To overcome
    this limitation, to an extent, ground terms instead of
    variables have been used in the assumptions.  But this
    change also made it necessary to change the conclusion of the
    antisymmetry rule from X=Y to eq(X,Y), since the builtin
    equality predicate of CHR requires X and Y to be unifiable.
    With these changes, the inference engine is able to derive
    that eq(c,a), but not that all three variables are equal,
    as in the original CHR version.
