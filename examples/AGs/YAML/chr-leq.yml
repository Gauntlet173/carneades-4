  title: Constraint Handling Rules Demo
  notes: >
    This illustrates how argumentation schemes are mapped to 
    Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) and support the full 
    generality of CHR.  Any CHR program can be represented with
    argumentation schemes in Carneades, with the added benefit
    of generating an argument graph which can be used to visualize
    and explain the program's reasoning.

    Using the SWI Prolog syntax for CHR: 
    
    reflexivity  @ X leq X <=> true.
    antisymmetry @ X leq Y, Y leq X <=> X = Y.
    transitivity @ X leq Y, Y leq Z ==> X leq Z.
    idempotence  @ X leq Y \ X leq Y <=> true.

language:
  leq/2: "%v â‰¤ %v"
  eq/2: "%v = %v"

argument_schemes:
  - id: reflexivity
    variables: [X]
    deletions: 
      - leq(X,X)
    conclusions:
      - true

  - id: antisymmetry
    variables: [X,Y]
    deletions:
      - leq(X,Y) 
      - leq(Y,X)
    conclusions:
      - eq(X,Y)

  - id: transitivity
    variables: [X,Y,Z]
    premises:
      - leq(X,Y)
      - leq(Y,Z)
    conclusions:
      - leq(X,Z)

  - id: idempotence
    variables: [X,Y]
    premises:
      - leq(X,Y)
    deletions:
      - leq(X,Y)
    conclusions:
      - true

assumptions:
  - leq(a,b)
  - leq(b,c)
  - leq(c,a)
