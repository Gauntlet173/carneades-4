  notes: >
    Here we illustrate one way to represent many of Doug Walton's argumentation
    schemes, including critical questions. This is work in progress.

language:
  expert/2: "%s is an expert in the %s domain."
  in_domain/2: "%s is in the domain of %s."
  asserts/2: "%s asserts that %s is true."
  untrustworthy/1: "%s is untrustworthy."
  biased/1: "%s is biased."
  n/1: 'It is not true that: "%s"'
  applicable/1: "Argument %s is applicable."
  based_on_evidence/1: "The assertion %v is based on evidence."

statements:
   expert(joe,climate): Joe is a climate expert.
   in_domain(n(caused_by(global_warming,humans)),climate): >
      The claim that global warming is not caused by humans is in the climate domain.
   asserts(joe,n(caused_by(global_warming,humans))): >
      Joe asserts that global warming is not caused by humans.
   n(caused_by(global_warming,humans)): >
      Global warming is not caused by humans.
   based_on_evidence(asserts(joe,n(caused_by(global_warming,humans)))): >
      Joe's assertion is based on evidence.
