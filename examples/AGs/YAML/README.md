These YAML files represent Carneades 4.x argument graphs.
The YAML format (scheme) illustrated here is the native and preferred 
text format for representing and interchanging argument 
graphs in Carneades 4.x.

The statement labels in these argument graphs have been asserted
manually and are used to test the CAES argument graph evaluator by 
the code in:

github.com/carneades/carneades-4/internal/test/caes_test.go

These tests evaluate all the argument graphs in this folder, 
compare the computed labels with the labels asserted in these 
files and reported any discrepencies.
