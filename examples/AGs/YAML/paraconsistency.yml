  note: >
    Inconsistent assumptions do not cause inconsistent conclusions
    to be derived for other issues.

statements:
  P: P is true
  ¬P: P is not true
  Q: Q is true.
  ¬Q: Q is not true

issues:
  i1: 
    positions: [P, ¬P]
  i2:
    positions: [Q, ¬Q]

arguments:
  a1:
    conclusion: Q
    premises: [P]
  a2:
    conclusion: ¬Q
    premises: [¬P]

# inconsistent assumptions!
assumptions: [P, ¬P]

tests:
  in:  [P, ¬P]
  out: [Q, ¬Q]
