  note: >
    Inconsistent assumptions do not cause inconsistent conclusions
    to be derived for other issues.

statements:
  p: P is true
  np: P is not true
  q: Q is true.
  nq: Q is not true

issues:
  i1: 
    positions: [p, np]
  i2:
    positions: [q, nq]

arguments:
  a1:
    conclusion: q
    premises: [p]
  a2:
    conclusion: nq
    premises: [np]

# inconsistent assumptions!
assumptions: [p, np]

tests:
  in:  [p, np]
  out: [q, nq]
