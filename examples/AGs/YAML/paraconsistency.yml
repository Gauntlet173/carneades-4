  title: Example of Paraconsistency
  note: >
    Inconsistent assumptions do not cause inconsistent conclusions
    to be derived for other issues.

statements:
  p: P is true
  ¬p: P is not true
  q: Q is true.
  ¬q: Q is not true

issues:
  i1: 
    positions: [p, ¬p]
  i2:
    positions: [q, ¬q]

arguments:
  a1:
    conclusion: q
    premises: [p]
  a2:
    conclusion: ¬q
    premises: [¬p]

# inconsistent assumptions!
assumptions: [p, ¬p]

tests:
  in:  [p, ¬p]
  out: [q, ¬q]
