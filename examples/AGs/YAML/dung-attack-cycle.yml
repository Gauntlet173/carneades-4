  title: Simulating a Dung abstract argumentation framework with an attack cycle
  source: >
    This example illustrates how any Dung AF can be simulated using
    CAES structured arguments.  Both the arguments and the attacks of
    the Dung AF are modeled by CAES arguments.  Attacks are modelled as
    undercutters.  CAES Statements model the conclusion and undercutter
    of each Dung argument.  If the Dung AF has m arguments and n
    attacks, the CAES translation has at most 2*m statements and m+n
    arguments.  Thus the translation has polynomial complexity.  The
    translation is not limited to grounded semantics, since other Dung
    semantics have analogues in CAES.  (Carneades 4.1 only *implements*
    grounded semantics currently.)
    The Dung AF simulated here is:
      Args  = {a,b} Attacks = {(a,b)(b,a)}


statements:
  ua: ¬app(a)
  ub: ¬app(b)

arguments:
  a: 
    conclusion: ub
    undercutter: ua
  b:
    conclusion: ua
    undercutter: ub

assumptions: []

tests:
  undecided: [ua,ub]
